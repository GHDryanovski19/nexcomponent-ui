## Customizing Colors in Client Projects

The provided UI library incorporates a set of predefined color variables to maintain consistency across projects. These colors can be effortlessly customized at the root level of your client projects to align with your brand identity or design requirements.

### Integration Steps

**Root Level Customization**: Modify the color variables within the :root selector to reflect your desired palette:

```css
:root {
  /* Primary colors */
  --nex-primary-color: #1f9be1;
  --nex-primary-contrast-color: #f3f3f3;

  /* Secondary colors */
  --nex-secondary-color: #ef910a;
  --nex-secondary-contrast-color: #f3f3f3;

  /* Tertiary colors */
  --nex-tertiary-color: #88ffca;
  --nex-tertiary-contrast-color: #f3f3f3;

  /* Quaternary colors */
  --nex-quaternary-color: #4addef;
  --nex-quaternary-contrast-color: #f3f3f3;

  /* Font color */
  --nex-font-color: #1e1d2a;

  /* Background color */
  --nex-background-color: #f3f3f3;

  /* Complimentary color */
  --nex-complimentary-color: #bababa;

  /* Bootstrap */
  --nex-success: #5cb85c;
  --nex-info: #5bc0de;
  --nex-warning: #f0ad4e;
  --nex-danger: #d9534f;
}
```

- Primary Colors: Adjust --nex-primary-color and --nex-primary-contrast-color for primary elements and their contrast.
- econdary Colors: Modify --nex-secondary-color and --nex-secondary-contrast-color for secondary elements.
- Tertiary and Quaternary Colors: Customize --nex-tertiary-color, --nex-tertiary-contrast-color, --nex-quaternary-color, and --nex-quaternary-contrast-color as needed.
